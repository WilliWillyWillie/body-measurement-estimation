Calculate Body Dimensions using Segmentation
    Getting Segmentation:
        1. Use MediaPipe Pose Landmarker.
        2. When all keypoints are present with high confidence level get segmentation mask.
        3. Extract necessary pose landmarker result and segmentation mask.
    Measure Shoulder, Waist Width, Height, and etc. in pixels
        1. Use pairs of keypoints to navigate the segmentation mask and move the keypoints to
        the left or right, or up and down depending on where the keypoints are. Move keypoints
        until the color is not white.
        2. Using the the updated coordinated of the pairs of keypoints, get the x coordinates
        (if getting width) or y coordinates(if getting height) and use the following formula to
        get the width/height: to be formulated
